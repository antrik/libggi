New in 2.0beta2.1: 1999-05-17;
* Misc bugfixes (see ChangeLog).
* Minor documentation updates.
* Autoconf now checks for headers as well as libraries for Glide, AAlib and
  SVGAlib.
* Should now compile on Linux libc5 and other systems which doesn't define
  MAP_FAILED.

* cube3d-demo
  - Fixed to work on GT_32BIT visuals.
* demo-demo
  - Better teach how to properly use ASYNC/SYNC mode.

* fbdev-target
  - Now supports acceleration on matroxfb. Should work on all supported cards.
  - Read /etc/fb.modes to get timing information - mode switching now
    works for non-KGIcon drivers too.
  - Fixed bug when running on a new VT (like XGGI does by default).
  - Don't try to change the palette when the application is switched away.
  - Now compiles on 2.0 kernels - someone with the proper hardware please
    test whether it actually works.
* svgalib-target
  - Major updates and bugfixes.
  - Now supports running in the background using the GGICMD_NOHALT_ON_UNMPAP
    standard API.
  - Console switching now works, but does _not_ use SIGUSR* - you can now use
    the SVGAlib target with pthreads!



New in 2.0beta2: 1999-04-01;
* Portability fixes for non-Linux platforms.
* Lots of bugfixes.
* Documentaion updates.
* Optimizations of the linear-* drawing libraries - now software drawing,
  ggiCrossBlit() and ggiPutBox() is much faster.
* Linux VT-switching now works with pthreads.
* New environment variable GGI_NEWVT which will cause Linux-console based
  targets to open a new VT instead of running on the current one.
* API for requesting Linux-console based targets not to halt when switching
  to another VT.
* New API functions ggiSetColorfulPalette(), ggiFlushRegion(),
  ggiResourceAcquire(), ggiResourceRelease(), ggiResourceMustAcquire(),
  ggiResourceFastAcquire(), ggiResourceFastRelease(), ggiEventsQueued(),
  ggiEventSend() and ggiEventSelect().
* ggiGetSelectFdSet() removed.
* The config file is now stored in /usr/local/etc/ggi by default.
* Support for setting the mansync framerate.
* New configure option --with-uninst-gii, which makes it possible to
  build LibGGI against an uninstalled copy of LibGII.
* All targets should now be compatible with Linux devfs systems.
* Support for targets using asynchronous acceleration.
* Big improvements in the event handling code, see the LibGII docs and NEWS
  file for info.

* stars-demo
  - Demonstrate how to runtime switch between X and DGA targets with help
    from the application.
* cube3d-demo
  - New demo which lets you run one to six arbitrary LibGGI applications
    on a rotating, zoomable, cube, which is displayed on any LibGGI target.

* X-target
  - Handle expose events internally.
* X/Xlib-targets
  - Much improved system for matching LibGGI graphtypes with X-visual types.
  - Support for StaticColor X-visuals.
  - Support for running in an already existing window or in the root window.
  - Don't close and reopen the window when changing modes.
* DGA-target
  - Use our own client-side implementation of XFree86DGA to get better
    stability and support for optionally mapping the video memory from
    a framebuffer device (= no root privs required for DGA).
  - Support for acceleration on X servers supporting DGA 1.1.
* fbdev-target
  - Fixed fatal bug which would cause segfault when stride != virtual x.
* glide-target
  - Improved GGI_AUTO handling, support for more resolutions.
  - Support for more than one 3DFX card.
  - Restrained refreshrates so you doesn't damage your monitor.
* svgalib-target
  - 32-bit modes should now work
  - "return key causes quit" problem fixed.
* vcsa-target
  - Much improved color mapping algorithm.
  - "-shade" option added, and made shading NOT be the default since it
     screws up the colormapping for normal text.
* file-target
  - Support for saving movies of running GGI applications.
