Next minor release (BUGFIX release)
------------------------------------------
Version : 2.0.2
Due : 2001-1[12]-??

- cleanup demo building and installation
- bring improved code in showaccel demo to showaccel2 demo
* why is directfb drawing on only every other pixel column? (was DFB bug)
* use config file instead of static accel_strings array in fbdev
* enable DirectFB
- Make XF86DGA working with XF86 3.x and XF86 4.x
- Verify and fix cross-compilation to other architectures
- Fix libtool to create shared libs instead of static ones
  on Linux/MIPS boxes. This misbehaviour lets compile and install, but don't
  run GGI on Linux/MIPS boxes.
- The default value of the configure option '--with-gii' should always be
  the same as the '--prefix' one, independent if '--prefix' is specified by
  the user or not, unless '--with-gii' is specified by the user itself.
  This simplifies compiling libggi on a machine with no root-permissions.
* disable libKGI target, because it's currently a "proof-of-concept"
- BUGFIX: tile-over-Xlib produces colors with blue characteristics!

------------------------------------------
Next major release
------------------------------------------
Version : 2.1.0
Due : ????-??-??

- libKGI-target (compiling framework, probably only working with Matrox Cards)
- make Xlib a helper target for X
- improve modelist.inc
- documentate tele-target in libggi/doc/targets.txt
- add display-auto to separate OS dependent auto-detect routines from
  libggi core

------------------------------------------
Over-Next major release
------------------------------------------
Version : 3.0.0
Due : ????-??-??

- A working full-featured KGI-target
- change way that pixela/pixel stubs are selected, integrate ggiFlush
  and ggiSetFlags with the changed() dl cascade, add renderers (in addition
  to extensions) to the cascade, add some infrastructure for next 
  cut of LibGGIMISC to make it easy for extensions to integrate with automatic
  frame flipping.  Make sure it's all fast and efficient.
- enhance config file system: aliases, in-file option strings, wildcards
- enhance dl system: allow single library to serve multiple suggest strings
- move libmmutil from libgalloc to libggi to allow normal ggi primitives
  to use batchops
- finish long-term plan
- implement below API additions
- implement below non-backward-compatible changes

------------------------------------------
Long-term plan
------------------------------------------

- improve fbdev mode negotiation.  Option to obey /etc/fb.modes or not.
- move display autodetection routines into a display-auto sublib, and
  create display-auto-linux, display-auto-bsd, etc, mapping them to
  display-auto in libggi.conf.

------------------------------------------
Things that will induce API additions
------------------------------------------
- make sure all bitfields (e.g. BM_TYPE) have associated _MASK/_SHIFT macros
- Figure out all the caveats for cloning a visual and add core support 
	and a ggiClone API function.
- Add a ggiFlushNeeded that checks to see if a ggiFlush should be called,
  but allows application to continue on its merry way if so.

------------------------------------------
Non backward-compatible changes
------------------------------------------
- Remove old ggi versions of event types, which were replaced by gii typedefs.
