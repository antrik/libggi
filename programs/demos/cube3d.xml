<refsect1><title>Description</title>

<para>
    <systemitem>cube3d</systemitem> is a LibGGI "middleend", that allows
    to run up to 6 LibGGI applications on one screen, mapped to the six
    sides of a cube.
</para>

<para>
    The programs program1 to program6 are invoked and mapped to the cube sides
    after the 3d program itself has started. You can interleave the program
    names with size parameters of the form -xxx,yyy that will ask the programs 
    that come later on the commandline to start up in that size.
    The default size is half that of the visual 3d is running on.
</para>

<para>
    You can add more programs while 3d is running by setting some environment 
    variables and starting them :
</para>

<screen>
    GGI_DISPLAY=display-memory:-input:keyfile:1048576:[0-5]:/dev/null
</screen>

<para>
    The [0-5] selects on which face of the cube you want the application to run.
</para>

<para>
    You should as well set <envar>GGI_DEFMODE</envar> to a mode with the same color
    organization like the one 3d itself is running on, and the mode, 3d
    believes it should run in, as specified with a size parameter.
</para>

<para>
    Once <systemitem>cube3d</systemitem> is invoked, the program will
    display the cube with the six other applications mapped to it. But
    you will probably only see application number 1 (and maybe 3 from
    behind), as this is the way the cube is oriented. The keyboard is
    redirected to the application that has the blinking border.
</para>

<para>
    # is the "escape" key. After pressing it, the blinking border
    should turn red. All further input now goes to the 3d program and is
    used to manipulate the appearance and behaviour of the cube:

    will center the currently active face (the one with the border) in a
    smooth motion and when this is finished, it will stop all motion.
    This is a toggle, that gets turned off automatically when the final 
    position is reached. That is, you can disable it on its way, which
    will leave the cube spinning in the current direction.

    will toggle backface culling. In that case, the three "back" sides of
    the cube are not drawn. Looks much less nice, but is faster. Use on slow
    systems.

    will toggle autoactivation. If this is on, the blinking frame will
    automatically move to the face, that is facing the viewer most
    directly, i.e. the "front" face. This can be quite irritating, especially,
    if the cube is moving fast. But it's cool at times ...

    will toggle transparency. The pixelvalue of 0x00000000 is treated as
    "transparent" usually. This not only looks better, but often even 
    improves performance, as there is less to draw. However things like
    shells (nixterm) might be hard to read on a colorful background, so
    you might want to turn it off at times.

    select the active console that will get input, when you leave the escaped
    mode. The blinking rectangle will move there. Together with 'c', this is
    used to get a particular console to the front.

    quit 3d. This also tries to kill the apps started from it. Externally
    started apps are _not_ killed. They will continue to run and might interfere
    with future runs of 3d, as they still hog the shared memory used to
    communicate between 3d and the apps.
