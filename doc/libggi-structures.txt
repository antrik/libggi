  typedef struct { sint16 x, y; } ggi_coord;

  typedef uint32 ggi_graphtype;

  typedef struct {
        sint32          frames;

        ggi_coord       dpp;
  } ggi_mode;


Description
-----------


The mode structure describes a visual configuration given by its size
and other graphic properties.


Structure Members
-----------------


`frames`
    The number of frames. Some displays have multi-buffer capabilities
    (double-buffering, triple-buffering,...). See libggi frame-related
    functions (ggi{s,g}et{Read,Write,Display}Frame) for information on
    working with multiple frames.

`visible`
    The size of the visible area in pixels. This is what the user will
    see.

`virt`
    The virtual size of the visual in pixels. It can be larger
    (but not smaller)
    than the visible area, in which case only a part of it is
    displayed.  It is useful for scrolling or backing up portions of
    screen efficiently.  See `ggi[Set|Get]Origin` functions for more.

`size`
    The size of the visible area in mm.

`graphtype`
    It holds information on the type of display.  libggi defines
    macros to construct graphtypes values or access individual field.

    `depth` ( access via `GT_DEPTH(gt)`, `GT_SETDEPTH(gt,x)` )
        The number of significant bits holding color information.

    `size` ( access via  `GT_SIZE(gt)`, `GT_SETSIZE(gt,x)` )
	The actual size (in bits) of a pixel.  For instance, on a 32
	bits X server the pixel size is 32 but the depth is only 24
	(8bits RGB channels, 8 unused).

    `scheme` ( access via  `GT_SCHEME(gt)`, `GT_SETSCHEME(gt,x)` )
	The following schemes are available :

	- `GT_TEXT` : text mode only
	- `GT_TRUECOLOR` : true color mode
	- `GT_GREYSCALE` : pixels represent level of gray
	- `GT_PALETTE` : pixels are entries in a CLUT (Color Look-Up Table)
	- `GT_STATIC_PALETTE`
	- `GT_SUBSAMPLE_YUV`
	- `GT_SUBSAMPLE_U_YCRBR`
	- `GT_SUBSAMPLE_S_YCRBR`
	- `GT_NIL`

    `subscheme` ( access via `GT_SUBSCHEME(gt)`, `GT_SETSUBSCHEME(gt,x)` )
	One of:
	
	- `GT_SUB_REVERSE_ENDIAN`
	- `GT_SUB_HIGHBIT_RIGHT`
	- `GT_SUB_PACKED_GETPUT`

    Graphtypes can be constructed directly or via the
    `GT_CONSTRUCT(depth,scheme,size)` macro.  The following common
    graphtypes are defined :

    - `GT_TEXT16`
    - `GT_TEXT32`
    - `GT_1BIT`
    - `GT_2BIT`
    - `GT_4BIT`
    - `GT_8BIT`
    - `GT_15BIT`
    - `GT_16BIT`
    - `GT_24BIT`
    - `GT_32BIT`
    - `GT_AUTO`
    - `GT_INVALID`

`dpp`
    It stands for dot-per-pixel.


When filling a mode structure for setting a visual, any field can be
assigned `GGI_AUTO` (`GT_AUTO` for graphtype) if a specific value
isn't required.

LibGGI color description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. manpage:: 3 ggi_color ggi_pixel


Synopsis
--------

::

  #include <ggi/ggi.h>

  typedef struct { uint16 r,g,b,a; }   ggi_color;

  typedef uint32   ggi_pixel;


Description
-----------


Colors in ggi are described generically through the display-independent
`ggi_color` structure. 16 bit channels are used to ensure sufficient
precision on most displays.


`ggi_pixel`\ s are display-dependent pixel values.  They are used by all
GGI drawing primitives for efficiency.  Use :man:`ggiMapColor(3)` to
convert ggi_colors to ggi_pixels.


Structure members
-----------------

`r`, `g` and `b` correspond to the red, green and blue channels.
Since libggi does not deal with alpha compositing, the
`a` (alpha) field is mainly there for padding and it is not used by
libggi. Setting this value has no effect in libggi itself, and it will
most probably not be unmapped correctly from `ggi_pixel`\ s. However,
some extensions might make use of it, in which case you should refer
to their documentation.


`ggi_pixel`\ s format depends on the actual display and mode. For those
who want to operate directly on pixel values, this format is described
in the `ggi_pixelformat` structure.


Pixel Arrays
------------

Although individual pixels are kept into 32 bits `ggi_pixel`, arrays
of pixels, as used in `ggi[Get|Put]*` functions, `ggiPackColors` and
`ggiUnpackPixels`, are stored in the display specific format, thus
packed according to the actual pixel size.  This size is given by the
`GT_SIZE` macro for `graphtype` or the `size` field of the
`ggi_pixelformat` structure.


The buffers provided to these functions must be big enough to store or
read enough pixels. Although it is safe to use 32 bits per pixel, the
optimum size (in bits) can be calculated by multiplying the number of
pixel by their size. Don't forget to round up to a multiple of 8 to
get the number of bytes.


If you want to access such buffers directly, do *not* use pointer
arithmetics with `ggi_pixel`\ s.

LibGGI direct buffer structure description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. manpage:: 3 ggi_directbuffer ggi_pixellinearbuffer ggi_pixelplanarbuffer ggi_samplelinearbuffer ggi_sampleplanarbuffer


Synopsis
--------

::

  #include <ggi/ggi.h>

  typedef struct {
	uint32		type;
	int		frame;

	ggi_resource_t	resource;

	void		*read;
	void		*write;

		void *extended;
	} buffer;
  } ggi_directbuffer;


Description
-----------

The `ggi_directbuffer` structure contains information on
target-dependent buffers to allow applications to access them
directly.


Structure Members
-----------------

:p:`type`
  
  ::
  
    /* Buffer types */
    #define GGI_DB_NORMAL      0x0001  /* "frame" is valid when set */
    #define GGI_DB_EXTENDED    0x0002
    #define GGI_DB_MULTI_LEFT  0x0004
    #define GGI_DB_MULTI_RIGHT 0x0008

    /* Flags that may be or'ed with the buffer type */
    #define GGI_DB_SIMPLE_PLB	0x01000000
    /* GGI_DB_SIMPLE_PLB means that the buffer
       has the following properties:
      type == GGI_DB_NORMAL
      read == write
      noaccess == 0
      align == 0
      layout == blPixelLinearBuffer
    */

:p:`frame`
    is the frame number as used in multiple buffering.  Note that each
    frame can export more than one DirectBuffer.

:p:`resource`
    is a pointer to a lowlevel resource. Certain DirectBuffers need to
    be explicitly acquired (i.e. locked) before using them
    (i.e. accessing their pointers).  Such a situation may arise if
    the underlying visual supports mixed acceleration and framebuffer
    access, but they cannot occur at the same time.  In that case,
    LibGGI needs to be informed when the application is using the
    framebuffer.

    You can determine whether the DirectBuffer needs to be acquired by
    using `ggiResourceMustAcquire`.  An acquire is done by using
    `ggiResourceAcquire` and it is released by calling
    `ggiResourceRelease`.

:p:`read`, :p:`write`
    are the addresses where the buffer is mapped to the application.
    Read and write access to the buffer is done using load and store
    instructions of the host CPU. Read operations should be performed
    using the :p:`read` buffer and write operations should be performed
    using the :p:`write` buffer. These might be the same, but need
    not. If they are, read/write may be done to either buffer. Please
    note, that either read or write may be `NULL`. These are
    write-only or read-only buffers, which might be caused by hardware
    limitations. Such buffers are not suited to do Read-Modify-Write
    operations, so take care.

    Be aware that these fields may be changed by an acquire, and that
    they may be `NULL` or invalid when the DirectBuffer is not
    acquired.

:p:`page_size`
    indicates a Paged buffer if not `0`.

    Successive access to addresses `addr0` and `addr1` of either read
    or write buffers with `addr0`/`page_size` != `addr1`/`page_size`
    may be very expensive compared to successive accesses with
    `addr0`/`page_size` == `addr1`/`page_size`.

    On i386 the penalty will be about 1500 cycles plus 4 cycles per to
    be remapped. Because of this, block transfer operations might
    become very inefficient for paged buffers. If there are two
    different buffers provided for read and write operations, you
    should do successive reads from one and do successive writes to
    the other. If not, it is recommended to copy pagewise into a
    temporary buffer and then to copy this temporary buffer back to
    screen.
 
:p:`noaccess`
    is a bitfield specifying an access restriction. When bit x is set,
    you may not access this DirectBuffer at the width of 2^x bytes. It
    is usually 0, but check it.

:p:`align`
    is a bitfield specifying another access restriction.  When bit x
    is set, you may only access this DirectBuffer at the width of 2^x
    bytes, when the access is aligned to a multiple of 2^x. Note that
    bit 0 is a bit bogus here, but it should be always 0, as then
    ((noaccess|align)==0) is a quick check for "no restrictions".

:p:`layout`
    is an enumeration specifying the buffer addressing scheme.
    Possible values are `blPixelLinearBuffer`, `blPixelPlanarBuffer`,
    `blExtended`, `blSampleLinearBuffer` and `blSamplePlanarBuffer`.
    See below for their definition.

:p:`buffer`
    is a union of all buffer info.  Check the `layout` member to see
    which member of use.


Pixel Linear Buffer
-------------------

::

  typedef struct {
	int		stride;		/* bytes per row		*/
	ggi_pixelformat *pixelformat;	/* format of the pixels		*/
  } ggi_pixellinearbuffer;


A linear buffer is a region in the application's virtual memory
address space. A pixel with the pixel coordinates (:p:`x`, :p:`y`) is
assigned a pixel number according to the following formula::

  pixel_number = (origin_y + y) * stride + origin_x + x;

In any case both `x` and `y` must not be negative, and less than the
buffer's width and height respectively. For top-left-origin screen
coordinates, `stride` and `origin_y` will both be positive. For
bottom-left-origin screen coordinates, `stride` and `origin_y` will
both be negative. This will result in the correct pixel number with
the same formula in both cases. The pixel number will be used to
address the pixel.


A certain number of bits is stored per pixel, and this is indicated in
the `ggi_pixelformat.access` field.  For some visuals, the buffer
might not be in host CPU native format and swapping operations need to
be performed before writes or after reads.


Pixel Planar Buffer
-------------------

::

  typedef struct {
	int		next_line;	/* bytes until next line	*/
	int		next_plane;	/* bytes until next plane	*/
	ggi_pixelformat *pixelformat;	/* format of the pixels		*/
  } ggi_pixelplanarbuffer;


Sample Linear Buffer
--------------------

::

  typedef struct {
	int		num_pixels;	/* how many pixelformats	*/
	int		stride;		/* bytes per row		*/
	ggi_pixelformat *pixelformat[4];/* format of the pixels		*/
  } ggi_samplelinearbuffer;


Sample Planar Buffer
--------------------

::

  typedef struct {
	int		next_line[3];	/* bytes until next line	*/
	int		next_plane[3];	/* bytes until next plane	*/
	ggi_pixelformat *pixelformat[4];/* format of the pixels		*/
  } ggi_sampleplanarbuffer;

  /* This is a very usefull marco to directly access visual palette entry */
  #define LIBGGI_PAL(vis)             ((vis)->palette)


Description
-----------

ggi_colormap structure can be considered as an interface between
target colormap and ggi internal colormap. Target specific information
is stored in the priv member. The ggi colormap is represented by the
clut member. It can be viewed as an abstract colormap whereas the priv
member can be view as the 'real' one. These members are initialised
during ggi initialisation. Colormaps (both target dependent and
independent ones) are updated/initialised with the ggiSetPalette
function.

The target is also responsible for setting the RO/RW area indices. RW
entries can be modified by any application whereas RO entries can't be
modified. In a target like X (or any other windowed one) where the
colormap is shared between all the applicataion, RO entries are the
shared color cells. These colormap entries are shared by all
applications so any changes will affect them. For example if you
display a 256 colors image without taking these entries into account,
the colors of the window manager and all the other windows are
screwed. The RW entries are the private color cells (ie) application
specific entries. The reason why the RO/RW management is not a native
ggi feature is simple if we consider this almost wrong analogy. GGI
can be seen as a graphical hardware and the target as its driver. The
hardware only give us access to 'raw' data. The way we represent/use
it is up to the target developer.

Every colormap function respect the standard ggi return policy which
is:
- 0 on normal completion
- >0 when giving additional hints or returning nonnegative integer data
- <0 for errors, see :man:`ggi-error(3)`


Structure Members
-----------------


`clut`
    The ggi side colormap.

`rw_start`, `rw_stop`
    Read/Write region boundaries. Any color in this region can be modified.

`ro_start`, `ro_end`
    Read only region boundaries. Colors in this region can't and must
    not be modified.

`priv`
    Target specific informations. This could be the target colormap structure.

`getPrivSize`
    Return the size in bytes of the priv member.

`setRW`, `setRO`
    Initialize the RW RO region of the colormap. These functions
    perform target specific operations and initialize region
    boundaries members of the colormap structure.

`getRW`, `getRO`
    Get RW RO region information from target.

`setPalette`
    One of the more important function. It initializes the colormap
    (both internal and target ones).

`findByColor`, `findByIdx`
    Find the index of the color passed as argument.

`matchByColor`
    Match the CLUT entry with the lowest index when more than one CLUT
    entry exists with the same color in it.

`matchByIdx`
    Similar to matchByColor. The correct pixel value of the color in
    the CLUT slot N is not necessarily N.
