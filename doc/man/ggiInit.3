.TH "ggiInit" 3 GGI
.SH NAME
\fBggiInit\fR, \fBggiExit\fR : Initialize and uninitialize LibGGI
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nb
#include <ggi/ggi.h>

int ggiInit(void);

int ggiExit(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBggiInit\fR initalizes the library. This function must be called before
using other LibGGI functions; otherwise the results will be undefined.

\fBggiExit\fR uninitializes the library (after being initalized by
\fBggiInit\fR) and automatically cleanup if necessary.  This should be
called after an application is finished with the library.  If any GGI
functions are called after the library has been uninitialized, the
results will be undefined.

\fBggiInit\fR allows multiple invocations.  A reference count is
maintained, and to completely uninitialize the library, \fBggiExit\fR must
be called as many times as \fBggiInit\fR has been called beforehand.
.SH RETURN VALUE
\fBggiInit\fR returns \fB0\fR for OK, otherwise an error code.

\fBggiExit\fR returns:
.TP
\fB0\fR
after successfully cleaning up,
.PP
.TP
\fB>0\fR
the number of 'open' \fBggiInit\fR calls, if there has been more than
one call to \fBggiInit\fR.  As \fBggiInit\fR and \fBggiExit\fR must be used in
properly nested pairs, e.g. the first \fBggiExit\fR after two
\fBggiInit`s will return `1\fR.
.PP
.TP
\fB>0\fR
error, especially if more \fBggiExit\fR calls have been done than
\fBggiInit\fR calls.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
Initialize and uninitialize LibGGI:

.nb
if (ggiInit() < 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Cannot initalize LibGGI!\n");
    exit(1);
}

/* Do some LibGGI stuff */

ggiExit();
