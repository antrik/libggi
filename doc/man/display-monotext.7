.SH NAME
\fBdisplay-monotext\fR : Emulate palettized modes on text-mode visuals
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nb
display-monotext: [ [-a=<acc>] | [ [-x=<acc>] [-y=<acc>] ] ] <target-spec>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Emulates palettized modes (\fBGT_PALETTE\fR) on another target which can
only do text modes, by representing the graphics as ASCII characters.
The effect is the much the same as the \fBAAlib\fR target, but does not
depend on any external libraries.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-x=<acc>\fR, \fB-y=<acc>\fR
A value between 1 and 5 which determines how accurately to map the
graphics to ASCII characters.  Lower values are less accurate, but
can represent a wider range of intensity levels.  The default is
x=2 and y=4.

.TP
\fB-a=<acc>\fR
Same as above, but sets both the x and y accuracy to the specified
value.

.TP
\fBtarget-spec\fR
