.TH "ggiSetColorfulPalette" "3ggi" "12 August 1999" "GGI" "LibGGI API Manual"
.SH NAME
ggiSetColorfulPalette \- Set a palette with a full range of all colors
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <ggi/ggi.h>
.sp
int ggiSetColorfulPalette(ggi_visual_t \fIvis\fB);
\fR.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
LibGGI guarantees that there will be a default palette when a palettized mode is
set. What this default is, however, is dependent on the visual. 
For example, the X target deliberately avoids setting all colors 
to avoid color-flashing when moving between windows.
.PP
Applications that want to ensure that they have a full scale of all colors
can call \fBggiSetColorfulPalette\fR after mode set. This function uses a
smarter color allocation scheme, causing good colors but still minimal
flashing in windowed targets.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
\fBggiSetColorfulPalette\fR returns the number of the first entry
changed. Negative values indicate error (codes).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fBggiSetPalette\fR(3)
