.SH NAME
\fBdisplay-quartz\fR : Display using Quartz2D on Mac OSX
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nb
.nf
display-quartz:       [-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]] [-nomansync]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
Uses MacOS X Quartz/Carbon API for display.

MacOS X 10.2.8 is required.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f(CW-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]\fR
This option will override the physical screen size reported by the
Quartz, which affects applications which wish to remain resolution
independent.  \fIsizex\fR, \fIsizey\fR are the x,y size of the entire
screen (not just the Carbon Window containing the visual) in
millimeters, unless the optional \f(CWdpi\fR string is affixed, in
which case, they represent resolution in dots-per-inch. Yes, there
are two equals signs there, for reasons of compatibility with other
targets.

.TP
\f(CW-nomansync\fR
Use of the mansync helper library to periodically flush contents
to the screen is disabled. This, of course, will result in
incorrect behaviour of applications that use syncronous
mode.
