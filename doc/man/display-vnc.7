             [-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]] [-server[=<dpy>|stdio]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Provides a linear framebuffer in main memory. A vnc client that
connects gets to see a copy of this framebuffer. The protocol
used is the remote framebuffer protocol, or the RFB protocol for
short.

The supported RFB protocol versions are 3.3, 3.7 and 3.8.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f(CW-client=<host>\fR
Make a connection to \fIhost\fR, instead of waiting for clients to
connect. A vnc viewer in listening mode is expected to be found on
\fIhost\fR.

.TP
\f(CW-copyrect=no|always\fR
Controls when the CopyRect encoding is used. Select \fIno\fR to disable
it completely, and \fIalways\fR to enable it when suitable even if there
is support for some other encoding the client has preferred. The default
is to only use the CopyRect encoding if it is the most preferred
encoding available.

.TP
\f(CW-display=<dpy>\fR
The display number clients should connect to. Display number 0 is
equivalent to tcp port 5900.

If the \fI-client\fR option is also given, this is instead the display
number this server connects to, and display number 0 is equivalent
to tcp port 5500 in that case.

.TP
\f(CW-hextile=no\fR
Disables the hextile encoding.

.TP
\f(CW-kold\fR
Kill On Last Disconnect. This option ends the application when the last
client disconnects. It can be useful in conjunction with the \fI-client\fR,
\fI-stdio\fR and :p:\f(CW-server=stdio\fR options so that the application does
not linger without any user feedback.

.TP
\f(CW-passwd=<password>\fR
The vnc client has to successfully encrypt a random challenge
with the stated \fIpassword\fR in order to connect. In the
\fIpassword\fR, only the eight first characters and the seven least
significant bits of every character are used in the authentication.

.TP
\f(CW-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]\fR
This option will provide a physical screen size for applications
which wish to remain resolution independent. \fIsizex\fR,:p:\fBsizey\fR
are the x,y size of the screen in millimeters, unless the optional
\f(CWdpi\fR string is affixed, in which case, they represent resolution
in dots-per-inch.

.TP
\f(CW-server[=<dpy>|stdio]\fR
To run both a server and open a client at the same time, but with
different displays numbers, the server display number can be specified
using \fI-server=<dpy>\fR. If no argument is given, the display number
is collected for the \fI-display\fR option. Use \fI-display=stdio\fR to
accept connections from the stdin file handle, which is suitable for
serving a GGI application as an inetd(8) \fIwait\fR type service.
The \fI-server=stdio\fR option is incompatible with the \fI-stdio\fR
option.

.TP
\f(CW-stdio\fR
Talk the RFB protocol on stdin/stdout instead of waiting for clients
to connect. Suitable for serving a GGI application as an inetd(8)
:p:\f(CWnowait\fR type service. One requirement though, is that the served
GGI application does not "chatter" on stdout and/or stderr.
The \fI-stdio\fR option is incompatible with the \fI-server=stdio\fR
option.

.TP
\f(CW-title=<title>\fR
The \fItitle\fR clients should use on their windows. If this option
is not specified, the default is "GGI on vnc".

.TP
\f(CW-zlib=<level>\fR
Specify the compression level to use for the zlib encoding. 0 for
no compression and 9 for maximum compression. Saying \fIno\fR here
disables the zlib encoding. If the option isn't specified, a default
compromize between speed and compression is selected.

.TP
\f(CW-zrle=<level>\fR
Specify the compression level to use for the ZRLE encoding. 0 for
no compression and 9 for maximum compression. Saying \fIno\fR here
disables the ZRLE encoding. If the option isn't specified, a default
compromize between speed and compression is selected.

.PP
.SH FEATURES

is only used for panning.

\f(CWggiSetFlags(3)\fR).
.IP \(bu 4
Multiple frames always available.
.IP \(bu 4
Panning always available.
.IP \(bu 4
Unaccelerated.
