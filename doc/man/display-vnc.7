.SH NAME
\fBdisplay-vnc\fR : Display on vnc clinet over a network
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nb
.nf
display-vnc: [-client=<host>] [-display=<dpy>] [-passwd=<pass>]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
Provides a linear framebuffer in main memory. A vnc client that
connects gets to see a copy of this framebuffer. The protocol
used is the remote framebuffer protocol, or the RFB protocol for
short.

The supported RFB protocol versions are 3.3, 3.7 and 3.8.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f(CW-client=<host>\fR
Make a connection to \fIhost\fR, instead of waiting for clients to
connect. A vnc viewer in listening mode is expected to be found on
\fIhost\fR.

.TP
\f(CW-display=<dpy>\fR
The display number clients should connect to. Display number 0 is
equivalent to tcp port 5900.

If the \fI-client\fR option is also given, this is instead the display
number this server connects to, and display number 0 is equivalent
to tcp port 5500 in that case.

.TP
\f(CW-passwd=<password>\fR
The vnc client has to successfully encrypt a random challenge
with the stated \fIpassword\fR in order to connect. In the
\fIpassword\fR, only the eight first characters and the seven least
significant bits of every character are used in the authentication.
