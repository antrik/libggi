.SH NAME
\fBdisplay-vnc\fR : Display on vnc client over a network
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nb
.nf
display-vnc: [-client=<host>] [-display=<dpy>] [-passwd=<pass>]
             [-zlib=<level>] [-zrle=<level>]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
Provides a linear framebuffer in main memory. A vnc client that
connects gets to see a copy of this framebuffer. The protocol
used is the remote framebuffer protocol, or the RFB protocol for
short.

The supported RFB protocol versions are 3.3, 3.7 and 3.8.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f(CW-client=<host>\fR
Make a connection to \fIhost\fR, instead of waiting for clients to
connect. A vnc viewer in listening mode is expected to be found on
\fIhost\fR.

.TP
\f(CW-display=<dpy>\fR
The display number clients should connect to. Display number 0 is
equivalent to tcp port 5900.

If the \fI-client\fR option is also given, this is instead the display
number this server connects to, and display number 0 is equivalent
to tcp port 5500 in that case.

.TP
\f(CW-passwd=<password>\fR
The vnc client has to successfully encrypt a random challenge
with the stated \fIpassword\fR in order to connect. In the
\fIpassword\fR, only the eight first characters and the seven least
significant bits of every character are used in the authentication.

.TP
\f(CW-zlib=<level>\fR
Specify the compression level to use for the zlib encoding. 0 for
no compression and 9 for maximum compression. Saying \fIno\fR here
disables the zlib encoding. If the option isn't specified, a default
compromize between speed and compression is selected.

.TP
\f(CW-zrle=<level>\fR
Specify the compression level to use for the ZRLE encoding. 0 for
no compression and 9 for maximum compression. Saying \fIno\fR here
disables the ZRLE encoding. If the option isn't specified, a default
compromize between speed and compression is selected.

.PP
.SH FEATURES
.IP \(bu 4
raw, zlib and ZRLE encodings, but only a subset (no palettization nor
run length encoding) of the ZRLE encoding for 16 and 32 bit clients.
.IP \(bu 4
Unaccelerated.
.PP
.SH BUGS
.IP \(bu 4
Special keys (i.e. shift, escape, etc) needs to be converted.
.IP \(bu 4
A DoS attack is easy as an existing client is disconnected as soon
as a new one connects.
