			=========================                   Updated:
			Display targets in LibGGI                   20030114
			=========================


The targets currently included in LibGGI are:
* Primary targets
	X, DGA, aa, fbdev, file, glide, memory, svgalib, vcsa

* Emulation targets (runs on top of one or more other targets)
	monotext, multi, palemu, tile, trueemu

* Special targets (these can only be opened explicitly by applications,
  setting GGI_DISPLAY to one of these causes undefined behaviour)
	sub


Detailed information about targets are available via man pages.
Get them by the 'man display-<targetname>' command.
