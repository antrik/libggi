<title>Graphics context</title>

<para>
LibGGI has a current context associated with each visual. This is done for
performance reasons, as LibGGI can set up pointers to optimized functions
when the GC changes (which can be monitored, as it may only be changed by
the functions mentioned below), or switch the hardware state efficiently.
