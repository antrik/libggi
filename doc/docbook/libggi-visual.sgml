<para>
A visual is simply a thing you can draw on. For example, a virtual console in
fullscreen mode, an X window, an invisible memory area, or a printer. It is
identified by its handle of type <type/ggi_visual_t/, which is given to all
drawing functions to indicate which visual to operate on.
</para>

<para>
Each visual is completely independent of other visuals. You can open different
visuals to display on multiple monitors and/or in multiple windows or to
work on "virtual" graphics devices like in-memory pixmaps or even PPM files
on disk.
</para>

<para>
A visual may also encompass any inputs that are associated with the
underlying graphics device.  For example, an X window visual usually
receives input from the X keyboard and pointer.
</para>

<para>
Most LibGGI functions are passed a visual returned by
<function/ggiOpen/ to know on which display they should
operate on.
</para>

<para>
<type/ggi_visual_t/ is opaque to the user. Do not try to access
any part of the structure directly. It may change without notice.

<term>Pixel</term>
<listitem><para>
or 'picture element' refers to a small rectangular part of an image.  It
has some attributes associated, e.g. a certain color, texture etc, which
are assumed to be constant over the whole area covered by it. All pixels
are assumed to have the same shape and size. A pixel is the smallest
element of a picture that can be controlled independently of the other
pixels in its attributes.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry id="dot">
<term>Dot</term>
<listitem>
<para>
The smallest unit that can be addressed for an image.  For uniform
pixels this may be the pixel itself; for textured pixels, such as
character glyphs, a dot is a pixel of the texture which
is assumed to be uniform. We will use this to refer to sub-pixel
coordinates, e.g. for a graphical pointer in text mode. As with pixels,
dots are assumed to have the same shape, size, color and intensity over
the whole area covered.  They have only a uniform texture.
</para>

<para>
Most LibGGI functions and structures use <emphasis/pixels/ rather than
dots.  This makes a difference for text modes, because a character is
treated as one pixel, but consists of a <property/dpp.x/ *
<property/dpp.y/ sized matrix of dots.
