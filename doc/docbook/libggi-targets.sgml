<para>
A display target is a collection of libraries used to connect LibGGI to
a graphical input/output system.  For example, the X target will use the
X protocol to open up an X window which is then used to display a GGI
application.

In this section, targets are named using their canonical suggest strings
(<token/display-/).  Targets can also be conveniently specified without the
<token/display-/ prefix.
