Display using Linux kernel framebuffer devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. manpage:: 7 display-fbdev

Synopsis
--------

::

  display-fbdev: [ [-noinput] | [ [-nokbd] | [-nomouse] ] ] [-novt]
		 [-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]] [<framebuffer>]


Description
-----------

Uses the Linux `/dev/fb*` devices to do fullscreen
graphics.

When using a regular fbdev driver, `/etc/fb.modes` is used to
determine the available modes for the device.  Driver timings and
resolutions can be automatically obtained when running under KGIcon.


Options
-------

:p:`framebuffer`
    The filename of the framebuffer target to use.  The default is to
    get it from the `FRAMEBUFFER` environment, or the framebuffer
    associated with the current console if that is unset.

``-nokbd``
    Do not open any libraries for keyboard input.

``-nomouse``
    Do not open any libraries for mouse input.

``-noinput``
    Same as both ``-nokbd`` and ``-nomouse``.

``-novt``
    Disable virtual console support.

``-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]``
    This option will provide a physical screen size for applications
    which wish to remain resolution independent.
    :p:`sizex`,:p:`sizey` are the x,y size of the screen in
    millimeters, unless the optional ``dpi`` string is affixed, in
    which case, they represent resolution in dots-per-inch.


Features
--------

- DirectBuffer always available.
- Accelerated when using KGIcon or matroxfb.
- Multiple frames.
- Panning.
