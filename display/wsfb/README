The wsfb GGI display device is the GGI display backend for the wsfb
interface. Please see wsdisplay(4) on an OpenBSD system (I expect this will
work with NetBSD as well).

$ export GGI_DISPLAY=display-wsfb

Currently, I am working on getting an 8bit display working on OpenBSD/sparc.

Sofar, things seem to work ok, but GGI never draws anything and has alot
of generic errors being called.

At least the framebuffer is mmap'ed correctly, as can be evidenced by the
short for(i.. loop that draws on the top 1/16th of the screen some numerical
data, but getting GGI to draw to this memory is eluding me at present.
