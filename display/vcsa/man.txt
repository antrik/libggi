Synopsis
--------

::

  display-vcsa : [ [-noinput] | [ [-nokbd] [-nomouse] ] ] [-ascii]
		   [-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]] [-shade] [<vcsa device>]


Description
-----------

Uses the Linux `/dev/vcsa*` devices to render text modes onto the
console.


Options
-------

``-nokbd``
    Do not open any libraries for keyboard input.

``-nomouse``
    Do not open any libraries for mouse input.

``-noinput``
    Same as both ``-nokbd`` and ``-nomouse``.

``-ascii``
    The ``-ascii`` option limits the color mapping to only using ASCII
    characters.  The default mode uses IBM special characters (the
    solid block mainly, and others when using ``-shade``).

``-shade``
    The ``-shade`` option turns on *shading mode*, which changes the
    color mapping so that it chooses characters which emulate a
    shading effect.  This makes a big improvement if using (some might
    say abusing :) the vcsa target for graphical purposes.

``-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]``
    This option will provide a physical screen size for applications
    which wish to remain resolution independent.  :p:`sizex`,
    :p:`sizey` are the x,y size of the screen in millimeters, unless
    the optional ``dpi`` string is affixed, in which case, they
    represent resolution in dots-per-inch.

:p:`vcsa device`
    The filename of the device file, defaulting to `/dev/vcsa` which
    draws on the current virtual console.
