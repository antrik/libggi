Synopsis
--------

::

  display-vnc: [-client=<host>] [-copyrect=no|always] [-display=<dpy>]
	       [-hextile=no] [-kold] [-passwd=<pass>]
	       [-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]] [-server[=<dpy>|stdio]]
	       [-stdio] [-tight] [-title=<title>] [-zlib=<level>|no]
	       [-zrle=<level>|no]


Description
-----------

Provides a linear framebuffer in main memory. A vnc client that
connects gets to see a copy of this framebuffer. The protocol
used is the remote framebuffer protocol, or the RFB protocol for
short.

The supported RFB protocol versions are 3.3, 3.7 and 3.8.


Options
-------

``-client=<host>``
    Make a connection to :p:`host`, instead of waiting for clients to
    connect. A vnc viewer in listening mode is expected to be found on
    :p:`host`.

``-copyrect=no|always``
    Controls when the CopyRect encoding is used. Select :p:`no` to disable
    it completely, and :p:`always` to enable it when suitable even if there
    is support for some other encoding the client has preferred. The default
    is to only use the CopyRect encoding if it is the most preferred
    encoding available.

``-display=<dpy>``
    The display number clients should connect to. Display number 0 is
    equivalent to tcp port 5900.

    If the :p:`-client` option is also given, this is instead the display
    number this server connects to, and display number 0 is equivalent
    to tcp port 5500 in that case.

``-hextile=no``
    Disables the hextile encoding.

``-kold``
    Kill On Last Disconnect. This option ends the application when the last
    client disconnects. It can be useful in conjunction with the :p:`-client`,
    :p:`-stdio` and :p:``-server=stdio`` options so that the application does
    not linger without any user feedback.

``-passwd=<password>``
    The vnc client has to successfully encrypt a random challenge
    with the stated :p:`password` in order to connect. In the
    :p:`password`, only the eight first characters and the seven least
    significant bits of every character are used in the authentication.

``-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]``
    This option will provide a physical screen size for applications
    which wish to remain resolution independent. :p:`sizex`,:p:`sizey`
    are the x,y size of the screen in millimeters, unless the optional
    ``dpi`` string is affixed, in which case, they represent resolution
    in dots-per-inch.

``-server[=<dpy>|stdio]``
    To run both a server and open a client at the same time, but with
    different displays numbers, the server display number can be specified
    using :p:`-server=<dpy>`. If no argument is given, the display number
    is collected for the :p:`-display` option. Use :p:`-display=stdio` to
    accept connections from the stdin file handle, which is suitable for
    serving a GGI application as an inetd(8) :p:`wait` type service.
    The :p:`-server=stdio` option is incompatible with the :p:`-stdio`
    option.

``-stdio``
    Talk the RFB protocol on stdin/stdout instead of waiting for clients
    to connect. Suitable for serving a GGI application as an inetd(8)
    :p:``nowait`` type service. One requirement though, is that the served
    GGI application does not "chatter" on stdout and/or stderr.
    The :p:`-stdio` option is incompatible with the :p:`-server=stdio`
    option.

``-tight``
    Enables the tight encoding.

``-title=<title>``
    The :p:`title` clients should use on their windows. If this option
    is not specified, the default is "GGI on vnc".

``-zlib=<level>``
    Specify the compression level to use for the zlib encoding. 0 for
    no compression and 9 for maximum compression. Saying :p:`no` here
    disables the zlib encoding. If the option isn't specified, a default
    compromize between speed and compression is selected.

``-zrle=<level>``
    Specify the compression level to use for the ZRLE encoding. 0 for
    no compression and 9 for maximum compression. Saying :p:`no` here
    disables the ZRLE encoding. If the option isn't specified, a default
    compromize between speed and compression is selected.


Features
--------

- Raw, CopyRect, Hextile, zlib, ZRLE and tight encodings. The CopyRect
  encoding is only used for panning. The tight encoding only has sensible
  support for 8 and 24 bits per pixel clients, which is why it is disabled
  by default.
- Multiple simultaneous clients.
- DirectBuffer always available, including tidy buffer mode (see
  :man:`ggiSetFlags(3)`).
- Multiple frames always available.
- Panning always available.
- Unaccelerated.

-------

The tight encoding uses the jpeg library from the Independent JPEG Group.


Bugs
----

- Special keys (i.e. shift, escape, etc) needs to be converted.
