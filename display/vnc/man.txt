Display on vnc clinet over a network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. manpage:: 7 display-vnc

Synopsis
--------

::

  display-vnc: [-client=<host>] [-display=<dpy>] [-passwd=<pass>]
	       [-zrle=<level>]


Description
-----------

Provides a linear framebuffer in main memory. A vnc client that
connects gets to see a copy of this framebuffer. The protocol
used is the remote framebuffer protocol, or the RFB protocol for
short.

The supported RFB protocol versions are 3.3, 3.7 and 3.8.


Options
-------

``-client=<host>``
    Make a connection to :p:`host`, instead of waiting for clients to
    connect. A vnc viewer in listening mode is expected to be found on
    :p:`host`.

``-display=<dpy>``
    The display number clients should connect to. Display number 0 is
    equivalent to tcp port 5900.

    If the :p:`-client` option is also given, this is instead the display
    number this server connects to, and display number 0 is equivalent
    to tcp port 5500 in that case.

``-passwd=<password>``
    The vnc client has to successfully encrypt a random challenge
    with the stated :p:`password` in order to connect. In the
    :p:`password`, only the eight first characters and the seven least
    significant bits of every character are used in the authentication.

``-zrle=<level>``
    Specify the copression level to use. 0 for no copression and 9 for
    maximum compression. Saying :p:`no` here disables the ZRLE encodig.
    If the option isn't specified, a default compromize between speed
    and compression is selected.


Features
--------

- Unaccelerated.


Bugs
----

- The raw and ZRLE encodings are the only supported encodings, and
  ZRLE only compresses raw tiles (i.e. palettization and run length
  encoding are not supported).
- Special keys (i.e. shift, escape, etc) needs to be converted.
- A DoS attack is easy as an existing client is disconnected as soon
  as a new one connects.
- Palette changes does not trigger a refresh on the client.
