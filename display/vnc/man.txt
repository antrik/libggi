  display-vnc: [-display=<dpy>]


Description
-----------

Provides a linear framebuffer in main memory. A vnc client that
connects gets to see a copy of this framebuffer. The protocol
used is the remote framebuffer protocol, or the RFB protocol for
short.

The supported RFB protocol versions are 3.3, 3.7 and 3.8.


Options
-------

``-display=<dpy>``
    The display number clients should connect to. Display number 0 is
    equivalent of tcp port 5900.
    

Features
--------

- Unaccelerated.


Bugs
----

- Clients are not authenticated.
- The raw encoding is the only supported encoding.
- Special keys (i.e. shift, escape, etc) needs to be converted.
- A DoS attack is easy as an existing client id disconnected as soon
  as a new one connects.
- Palettized modes don't appear to work...
