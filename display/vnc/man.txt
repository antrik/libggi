Display on vnc client over a network

.. manpage:: 7 display-vnc

Synopsis
--------

::

  display-vnc: [-client=<host>] [-copyrect=no|always] [-display=<dpy>]
	       [-hextile=no] [-kold] [-passwd=<pass>] [-stdio]
	       [-title=<title>] [-zlib=<level>] [-zrle=<level>]


Description
-----------

Provides a linear framebuffer in main memory. A vnc client that
connects gets to see a copy of this framebuffer. The protocol
used is the remote framebuffer protocol, or the RFB protocol for
short.

The supported RFB protocol versions are 3.3, 3.7 and 3.8.


Options
-------

``-client=<host>``
    Make a connection to :p:`host`, instead of waiting for clients to
    connect. A vnc viewer in listening mode is expected to be found on
    :p:`host`.

``-copyrect=no|always``
    Controls when the CopyRect encoding is used. Select :p:`no` to disable
    it completely, and :p:`always` to enable it when suitable even if there
    is support for some other encoding the client has preferred. The default
    is to only use the CopyRect encoding if it is the most preferred
    encoding available.

``-display=<dpy>``
    The display number clients should connect to. Display number 0 is
    equivalent to tcp port 5900.

    If the :p:`-client` option is also given, this is instead the display
    number this server connects to, and display number 0 is equivalent
    to tcp port 5500 in that case.

``-hextile=no``
    Disables the hextile encoding.

``-kold``
    Kill On Last Disconnect. This option ends the application when the last
    client disconnects. It can be useful in conjunction with the :p:`-client`
    and :p:`-stdio` options so that the application does not linger without
    any user feedback.

``-passwd=<password>``
    The vnc client has to successfully encrypt a random challenge
    with the stated :p:`password` in order to connect. In the
    :p:`password`, only the eight first characters and the seven least
    significant bits of every character are used in the authentication.

``-stdio``
    Talk the RFB protocol on stdin/stdout instead of waiting for clients
    to connect. Suitable for serving a GGI application as an inetd(8)
    :p:``nowait`` type service. One requirement though, is that the served
    GGI application does not "chatter" on stdout and/or stderr.

``-title=<title>``
    The :p:`title` clients should use on their windows. If this option
    is not specified, the default is "GGI on vnc".

``-zlib=<level>``
    Specify the compression level to use for the zlib encoding. 0 for
    no compression and 9 for maximum compression. Saying :p:`no` here
    disables the zlib encoding. If the option isn't specified, a default
    compromize between speed and compression is selected.

``-zrle=<level>``
    Specify the compression level to use for the ZRLE encoding. 0 for
    no compression and 9 for maximum compression. Saying :p:`no` here
    disables the ZRLE encoding. If the option isn't specified, a default
    compromize between speed and compression is selected.


Features
--------

- Raw, CopyRect, Hextile, zlib and ZRLE encodings. The CopyRect encoding
  is only used for panning.
- Multiple simultaneous clients.
- DirectBuffer always available, including tidy buffer mode (see
  :man:`ggiSetFlags(3)`).
- Multiple frames always available.
- Panning always available.
- Unaccelerated.


Bugs
----

- Special keys (i.e. shift, escape, etc) needs to be converted.
