The vgl GGI display device is the GGI display backend for the FreeBSD libvgl
library. Please see vgl(3) on a FreeBSD system (>=3.0) for more info.

It supports only VESA modes. Linear framebuffer is used if available.
Note that the FreeBSD VESA driver only proposes modes for which it has BIOS
support. Consequently, linear framebuffer will be only available with
graphic cards that have BIOS of revision higher than 2.0.

There's an exception though. The s3 module available under -current and
-stable offers to use the linear framebuffer of S3 cards that only have
1.2 BIOS revision. This is based on the patch of pdh@colonel-panic.com
located at http://www.colonel-panic.com/linux.

Directbuffer is supported by the display-vgl if you enable it like this:

$ export GGI_DISPLAY=display-vgl:-usedb:

There are some caveats with Truecolor. First of all, 24 bit mode is not
supported. You can use 16 and 32bits modes with the Directbuffer without
any trouble. But when using these modes with drawing functions, there's
still some problems with ggiPutBox() (as I can guess with the demo
program). This has to be fixed.

Have fun!
