PalEmu README
=============

Last 20th January 2003.


Introduction
------------

PalEmu is a GGI display target that emulates a palettized visual (e.g.
8 bit) on a truecolor visual (e.g. 24 bit).

Here's how it works:

    1)  First specify the target as "palemu", for example:

        export GGI_DISPLAY=palemu

	You can also specify the parent target, as in :

	export GGI_DISPLAY=palemu:fbdev
	
    2)	There are a number of optional arguments. These must begin with
	a minus ('-'), and terminated by a colon. Arguments can be
	separated by whitespace or by a colon. 

	Currently supported arguments:

		-parent=<modestr>

	For example:

		export GGI_DISPLAY=palemu:-p=[c32]:X

    3)	Finally, just run a program that uses a GT_PALETTE mode.  It
        obviously won't be as fast as a native palettized mode, but it
	should be acceptable.  Programs that make extensive use of the
	palette for special effects will be worse hit than programs that
	rarely change it.


Have fun,
