Display using Quartz2D on Mac OSX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. manpage:: 7 display-quartz


Synopsis
--------

::

  display-quartz:	[-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]] [-nomansync]


Description
-----------


Uses MacOS X Quartz/Carbon API for display.

MacOS X 10.2.8 is required.


Options
-------

``-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]``
    This option will override the physical screen size reported by the
    Quartz, which affects applications which wish to remain resolution
    independent.  :p:`sizex`, :p:`sizey` are the x,y size of the entire
    screen (not just the Carbon Window containing the visual) in
    millimeters, unless the optional ``dpi`` string is affixed, in
    which case, they represent resolution in dots-per-inch. Yes, there
    are two equals signs there, for reasons of compatibility with other
    targets.

``-nomansync``
    Use of the mansync helper library to periodically flush contents
    to the screen is disabled. This, of course, will result in
    incorrect behaviour of applications that use syncronous
    mode.


Features
--------

- Directbuffer
