.. manpage::  7 display-monotext


Synopsis
--------

::

  display-monotext: [ [-a=<acc>] | [ [-x=<acc>] [-y=<acc>] ] ] <target-spec>


Description
-----------


Emulates palettized modes (`GT_PALETTE`) on another target which can
only do text modes, by representing the graphics as ASCII characters.
The effect is the much the same as the `AAlib` target, but does not
depend on any external libraries.


Options
-------

``-x=<acc>``, ``-y=<acc>``
    A value between 1 and 5 which determines how accurately to map the
    graphics to ASCII characters.  Lower values are less accurate, but
    can represent a wider range of intensity levels.  The default is
    x=2 and y=4.

``-a=<acc>``
    Same as above, but sets both the x and y accuracy to the specified
    value.
