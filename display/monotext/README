MonoText README
===============

Last updated 25th July 1998.


Introduction
------------

MonoText is a GGI display target that emulates an 8 bit visual on a
text-only visual.  If you've ever seen AAlib, then this target does
essentially the same thing (but has been written from scratch).

Here's how it works:

    1)  First specify the target as "monotext", for example:

        export GGI_DISPLAY=monotext

	You can also specify the parent target, as in :

	export GGI_DISPLAY=monotext:terminfo
	
    2)  There is an optional argument "-a" which specifies the Accuracy
        of the mapping from graphics -> text characters.  There are
	currently five values, "1" .. "5".  For example:

	export GGI_DISPLAY=monotext:-a4:terminfo

    3)	Next, run a program that uses GT_8BIT mode.  Other graphtypes
	are currently not supported (but planned).  The width and height
	must be a multible of the parent size (e.g. 80x25) and the
	accuracy size (e.g. accuracy "4" is 2x4).  So in that example,
	the size must be a multible of 160x100.

    4)	It is planned to be able to change the accuracy level
        "on-the-fly" with a hotkey: CTRL+ALT+a.
