Synopsis
--------

::

  display-directx:	[ [-keepcursor] [-nocursor] [-noinput] [-physz==<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]] ]


Description
-----------


Used for Win32 DirectX port of libGGI.


Options
-------

``keep-cursor``
    Shows the standard arrow cursor in the window, instead of the default
    dot cursor.

``no-cursor``
    No cursor is displayed in the window.

``-noinput``
    DirectX events sent to the window are not captured and merged with
    any other LibGII input sources. This allows one to take input from
    raw devices without receiving duplicate events should DirectX also
    be configured to use the device.

``-physz==<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]``
    This option will override the physical screen size reported by the
    DirectX, which affects applications which wish to remain resolution
    independent.  :p:`sizex`,:p:`sizey` are the x,y size of the entire
    screen (not just the DirectX window containing the visual) in
    millimeters, unless the optional ``dpi`` string is affixed, in
    which case, they represent resolution in dots-per-inch. Yes, there
    are two equals signs there, for reasons of compatibility with
    other targets.


Features
--------

- DirectBuffer always available.
