Synopsis

::

  display-directx:	[ [-inwin=<winid>] [-keepcursor] [-nocursor] [-noinput] [-physz==<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]] ]


Description
-----------


Used for Win32 DirectX port of libGGI.


Options
-------

``-inwin=<winid>|root``
    Run in already-existing window with id :p:`winid`.  This can be   
    used to embed a LibGGI application into a DirectX application. The
    value should be a DirectX window ID expressed as a decimal,
    hexadecimal or octal number in C syntax. The special string "root"
    will cause the application to run in the root window. Note that in the root window,
    you may need to explictly select a LibGII input source using the
    `GGI_INPUT` environment variable as Windows will absorb all events
    sent to the window.
    When using the root window other features (like direct framebuffer
    access and video hardware mode selection) may be available which
    are not available when the application is running in a normal window.
    

``-nocursor``, ``-keepcursor``
    Normal behavior of display-directx is to create a small dot mouse
    cursor pixmap which is visible when the mouse is positioned over the
    window containing the visual. With the former option, the DirectX
    mouse cursor will be invisible when it is over the visual, with the
    latter, the cursor from the root window is used unaltered.  If both
    options are supplied, the latter takes precedence.
    Note, that none of them works with the -inwin option.


``-noinput``
    DirectX events sent to the window are not captured and merged with
    any other LibGII input sources. This allows one to take input from
    raw devices without receiving duplicate events should DirectX also
    be configured to use the device.

``-physz==<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]``
    This option will override the physical screen size reported by the
    DirectX, which affects applications which wish to remain resolution
    independent.  :p:`sizex`,:p:`sizey` are the x,y size of the entire
    screen (not just the DirectX window containing the visual) in
    millimeters, unless the optional ``dpi`` string is affixed, in
    which case, they represent resolution in dots-per-inch. Yes, there
    are two equals signs there, for reasons of compatibility with
    other targets.


Features
--------

- DirectBuffer always available.
