Description
-----------


Used for Win32 DirectX port of libGGI.


Options
-------

``-inwin=<winid>|root``
    Run in already-existing window with id :p:`winid`.  This can be   
    used to embed a LibGGI application into a DirectX application. The
    value should be a DirectX window ID expressed as a decimal,
    hexadecimal or octal number in C syntax. The special string "root"
    will cause the application to run in the root window. Note that in the root window,
    you may need to explicitly select a LibGII input source using the
    `GGI_INPUT` environment variable as Windows will absorb all events
    sent to the window.
    When using the root window other features (like direct framebuffer
    access and video hardware mode selection) may be available which
    are not available when the application is running in a normal window.

``-fullscreen``
    If mode switching is required for the mode, this option makes it
    possible to set it. Superior to :p:`-inwin=root`.

``-nocursor``, ``-keepcursor``
    Normal behavior of display-directx is to create a small dot mouse
    cursor pixmap which is visible when the mouse is positioned over the
    window containing the visual. With the former option, the DirectX
    mouse cursor will be invisible when it is over the visual, with the
    latter, the cursor from the root window is used unaltered.  If both
    options are supplied, the latter takes precedence.
    Note, that none of them works with the -inwin option.


``-noinput``
    DirectX events sent to the window are not captured and merged with
    any other LibGII input sources. This allows one to take input from
    raw devices without receiving duplicate events should DirectX also
    be configured to use the device.

``-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]``
    This option will override the physical screen size reported by the
    DirectX, which affects applications which wish to remain resolution
    independent.  :p:`sizex`,:p:`sizey` are the x,y size of the entire
    screen (not just the DirectX window containing the visual) in
    millimeters, unless the optional ``dpi`` string is affixed, in
    which case, they represent resolution in dots-per-inch. Yes, there
    are two equals signs there, for reasons of compatibility with
    other targets.


Features
--------

- DirectBuffer
- Multiple frames (up to 16)
- Panning


Bugs
----

- On palettized windowed modes (i.e. not with -fullscreen) the first and
  last 10 entries of the palette are reserved by Windows and will not
  behave correctly. Even with the -fullscreen option, palettized modes
  can have problems with the first and the last entry, depending on what
  version of Windows is running.

- Can not draw directly in video ram, instead uses a intermediate buffer
  that is copied to video ram at regular intervals.

- The rate at which the above copy happens is fixed at 30Hz, and cannot
  be controlled by the user. The environment variable ``MANSYNC_FPS``
  should probably be used.

- Does not fall back to fullscreen if -fullscreen is not specified. That
  should ideally happen when the requested graphics mode is incompatible
  with the current Windows graphics mode and a matching fullscreen mode
  is there.
