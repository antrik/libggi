Synopsis
--------

::

  display-ipc: [-input] [-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]]
	       -semid=<semid> -shmid=<shmid> -socket=<socket>

Description
-----------

Uses a shared memory segment for inter-process communication.
Expects the client to specify the socket, semid and shmid options.

Options
-------

``-input``
    If the ``-input`` option is set, an input buffer of `INPBUFSIZE`
    (default are 8192 bytes) as #define'd in `ggi/display/ipc.h` is
    allocated at the start of the requested memory area.

    When running on shared memory, this option enables you to give
    input (using :man:`giiEventSend(3)`\ ) to other processes sharing
    that segment. This technique is demonstrated in :man:`cube3d(1)`
    and can be used for things like GGI multiplexers.
    libgii's :man:`input-memory(7)` is internally used for input handling.

``-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]``
    This option will provide a physical screen size for applications
    which wish to remain resolution independent.  :p:`sizex`,
    :p:`sizey` are the x,y size of the screen in millimeters, unless
    the optional ``dpi`` string is affixed, in which case, they
    represent resolution in dots-per-inch.

``-socket=<socket>``
    Specify the path to the socket.

``-semid=<semid>``
    Specify the sem id. Seem to be not used anywhere

``-shmid=<shmid>``
    Specify the shared memory identifier to use.

    On win32, :p:`sid` is the HANDLE returned by a call to
    ``CreateFileMapping`` in decimal form.


Features
--------

- DirectBuffer support always available.
- Unaccelerated.
