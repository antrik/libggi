Description
-----------

Emulates a linear framebuffer in main memory. The framebuffer can be a
shared memory segment, an area specified by the application, or an
area allocated by `display-memory` itself.


Options
-------

``-input``
    If the ``-input`` option is set, an input buffer of `INPBUFSIZE`
    (default is 8192 bytes) as #define'd in `ggi/display/memory.h` is
    allocated at the start of the requested memory area.

    When running on shared memory, this option enables you to to give
    input (using :man:`giiEventSend(3)`\ ) to other processes sharing
    that segment. This technique is demonstrated in :man:`cube3d(1)`
    and can be used for things like GGI multiplexers.

``-noblank``
    If the ``-noblank`` option is set, the framebuffer will not be
    filled with solid black when the mode of the visual is set.  This
    is useful for preserving data from other sources when using a
    preallocated area of memory as a framebuffer.

``-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]``
    This option will provide a physical screen size for applications
    which wish to remain resolution independent.  :p:`sizex`,
    :p:`sizey` are the x,y size of the screen in millimeters, unless
    the optional ``dpi`` string is affixed, in which case, they
    represent resolution in dots-per-inch.

``-pixfmt=<format_string>``
    This option will provide a non-default pixel format explicitly.
    Currently the accepted format of :p:`format_string` is something
    like ``"r5b5g5p1"``, which would specify a pixel where the low bit
    of the pixel is unused padding, followed by 5 bits of green, then
    5 bits of blue and finally 5 bits of red, with the remaining high
    bits, if any, being unused pad. A more formal description of this
    format string will be provided (and more strings accepted) in
    future LibGGI releases.

``[-layout=<fstride>[[plb<lstride>]|[plan<pstride>,<plstride>]]]``
    This option will provide a non-default framebuffer layout
    explicitly.  The :p:`fstride` parameter denotes the number of
    bytes between frames in the framebuffer, and will default to the
    size of the virtual screen in bytes if nonpresent or set to 0.
    Following fstride, the string ``plb`` denotes a linear
    packed-pixel framebuffer, or the string ``plan`` instead denotes a
    planar framebuffer.  The packed-pixel framebuffer layout is the
    default.  If the string ``plb`` is present, a horizontal stride
    :p:`lstride` may appear, denoting the number of bytes that elapse
    between the beginning of one line and the next.  This will default
    to the size of a horizontal line in bytes if nonpresent or set to
    zero.  If the string "plan" is present, up to two numbers, comma
    separated, may appear after the string.  The first number,
    :p:`pstride` denotes the number of bytes which elapse between the
    beginning of one plane and the next.  This will default to the
    minimum integral number of bytes that may contain one bitplane of
    the virtual screen if nonpresent or set to zero.  The second
    number, :p:`plstride` denotes the number of bytes that elapse
    between the beginning of one bitplane-line and the next.  This
    will default to the minimum integral number of bytes which may
    contain one bitplane-line of the virtual screen if nonpresent or
    set to zero.

    More strings and format parameters may accepted in future LibGGI
    releases.

``shmid:<sid>``
    use existing shared memory ID :p:`sid`

    On win32, :p:`sid` is the HANDLE returned by a call to
    ``CreateFileMapping`` in decimal form.

``keyfile:<size>:<id>:<fname>``
    create a new shm segment with id ``ftok(fname,id)`` of size
    :p:`size` (preferred method !). See :man:`ftok(3)`.

    On win32, the newly created shared memory mapping has the object
    name: ``ggi-display-memory-shm:<fname>:<ascid>``, where all
    backslashes have been converted to forward slashes in :p:`fname`
    and :p:`ascid` is the ascii value of :p:`id` in decimal form.
    If this object does already exist (and is a file mapping) it will
    be used, so two apps can share memory by using the same
    ``keyfile`` arguments on win32.

``pointer``
    use the memory pointed to by :p:`argptr` (only available to
    applications calling `ggiOpen`).

.. important::

    If you specify a memory area to use - be sure it's big enough as
    no checks can or will be made that a certain mode fits into it.
