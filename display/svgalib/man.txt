  display-svgalib: [-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]]


Description
-----------

graphics card. You may need to be root in order to have IO permissions
to drive the VGA device.


Options
-------

``-physz=<sizex>,<sizey>[dpi]``
    This option will provide a physical screen size for applications
    which wish to remain resolution independent.  :p:`sizex`,
    :p:`sizey` are the x,y size of the screen in millimeters, unless
    the optional ``dpi`` string is affixed, in which case, they
    represent resolution in dots-per-inch.


Features
--------

- DirectBuffer is available for the 320x200x8 mode. For other modes,
  support is only available if SVGAlib supports linear addressing.

- Unaccelerated
