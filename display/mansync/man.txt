  display-mansync


Description
-----------

Helper library for the implementation of SYNC mode on targets which are
inherently ASYNC (e.g. X) and require manual flushes of the framebuffer.

A target wishing to use mansync should open mansync with MANSYNC_open()
in it's own GGIopen().
It must pass a pointer of a structure containing a pointer to _ggi_opmansync
structure as the 2nd argument to MANSYNC_open(),
and must define the following macros::

  MANSYNC_init(vis)
  MANSYNC_deinit(vis)
  MANSYNC_start(vis)
  MANSYNC_stop(vis)
  MANSYNC_ignore(vis)
  MANSYNC_cont(vis)

which is supposed to call the functions in _ggi_opmansync respectively.

Mansync provides the following functions::

  int _GGI_mansync_init(vis);
  int _GGI_mansync_deinit(vis);
	Initialize/deinitialize mansync for given visual.

  int _GGI_mansync_start(vis);
  int _GGI_mansync_stop(vis);
	Start/stop mansync handling. (process,thread,etc.)
	You don't need to explicitly call these;
	MANSYNC_SETFLAGS does it for you.

  int _GGI_mansync_ignore(vis);
  int _GGI_mansync_cont(vis);
	Temporarily start/stop mansync, e.g. during mode set.
	It is o.k. to use them even if mansync has not been started.

  MANSYNC_SETFLAGS(vis,flags)
	mansync management in ggiSetFlags().

(The above functions return 0 if successful, -1 if not.)

  MANSYNC_open(vis,priv);
	loads helper-mansync. On success, priv->mod_mansync != NULL
  MANSYNC_close(priv);
	unloads helper-mansync.

Please see display/X, display/aa, display/quartz or display/tile
to see how mansync is used.  The functions should be transparent enough.

.. important::

    You're responsible for locking your own visual, not mansync!


Environment variables
---------------------

`GGI_MANSYNC_FPS`
    This variable specifies the framerate for targets emulating
    synchronous mode. The default is 20fps.  If you are experiencing
    problems with the X target over relatively slow remote connections
    it might be due to connection overload. You might want to try with
    a lower `GGI_MANSYNC_FPS` setting.
